= Configuring Web Pages

One of the most common elements used, particularly with command line-centric labs are Terminals, or _"ttys"_. In this lab, we will be configuring several terminals, each with a different purpose.

== General Overview

The terminals are Web Terminals, ie ttys served over HTTPS, and are currently based on `wetty`. By default, the terminals are _Pre-ssh'd_ to the target host and this is configurable. IE the terminal session can be pre-authenticated to the target host.

|NOTE For security reasons it is recommended that the terminals use SSH keys and this is enabled *by default*. Password-based authentication is available but passwords can be viewed and obtained by non-root users and may be considered a potential security hole.


are pre-authenticated to the target host. This is particularly important when the target host is a shared environment such as a lab environment. If the terminals are not pre-authenticated, then the user will be prompted for credentials when they open the terminal. This is not a problem in a dedicated environment such as a workshop.
, or the user can be prompted for credentials. The terminals are also configurable to be either single or double paned. The double paned terminals are useful for example when running a long running Ansible Playbook in one pane and allowing the user to continue to use the other pane.

| NOTE All "tabs" are Container based services and it is relatively simple to add new ones. The only real requirement is that the service is accessible via a URL and is iFrame friendly.


=== Enabling Tmux

All the terminal services can, optionally, create unique `tmux` sessions. This generally gives a better user experience as the user can refresh their browser and re-attach to their terminal sessions and maintain their session history. It is *recommended* that this is enabled.

In addition, from a support and assistance perspective, this allows Lab facilitators and instructors to attach to the user's terminal session and assist them with any issues they may be having.

Finally, whilst the student does not have to be exposed to `tmux` it does allow both Instructors and students to exploit and customize tmux features if they so wish.

== Configuring the Double Terminals

This module will walk you through the steps of configuring the Double Terminal, with two panes, which are fully configurable and can be logged in as 2 different users for example `developer` and `root` or offer 2 ttys logged in as the same user. 

This can be a useful feature particularly when there is protracted output such a long-running Ansible Playbook which can be launched in 1 tty and allowed to run whilst the user can continue to use the other tty.

. *If* the lab requires it enables root to ssh to the target host. 
.. This is, generally, not recommended - consider using `sudo` etc instead.
. *If* the lab requires it enables tmux for the terminals. *Recommended*
. The list of users that can be enabled as `ssh` users on the target host.
. The list of tabs and services to enable eg `double_tty`
